# Brief Introduction
- Advantage, automatic get, post tunning and we can get complete information if target parameter is Vulnerable to common or advanced issues.
- We don't need seperate tools to test common vulnerablities. This is all in one tool. 

# Vulnerablities Assessment
- If owasp top 10 vulnerablities are passed, it means we need manually fine tune our paylaods
- Automatically scan/fuzz for common OWASP TOP vulnerabilities for:
1. PHP
2. SSI
3. COMMAND/TEMPLATE INJECTIONS
4. LFI,RFI
5. ENCODED
5A. Base 64 ENCODE
5B. HEXA DECIMENAL ENCODE
5C. SINGLE TO DOUBLE ENCODE
5D. OBFUSCATION ENCODE

# Increase
- Add, Remove payloads

# Fine Tune
- Fine tune what payload worked or blocked

# Features
- Maavi is a new concept to scan for fuzzing to vulnerabilities searching to fine tuning any payload

# Payloads
- Maavi helps in:
- XSS
- Csrf
- Ssrf
- SSI
- OWASP top 10
- PHP Injections
- Bufferoverflows
- Redirects
- Open Redirects  
- Add anything
- more....

# Fine Tune
- See what payload worked and what don't filter on the fly and fine tune then simply inject
